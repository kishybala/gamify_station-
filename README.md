Gamified Campus Contribution Tracker is a web app that turns campus activities into a fun game. Students can volunteer for tasks, earn points, collect badges, and climb leaderboards, while councils and mentors manage and approve contributions. It motivates more participation by making campus work engaging and rewarding.
